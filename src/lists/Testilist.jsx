                This Theme was easy to install and configure. When I got stuck, I reached out to support and Alex provided super easy screenshots showing where to go to configure areas I wanted to modify. Fast and friendly support and a beautiful theme to work with. It was money well spent (and way cheaper than comparable themes bought through shopify)."
